# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms – SY AIDS

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) concepts for **Second Year – Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (SY AIDS)** students.  
Each program (`DS1.cpp` to `DS10.cpp`) demonstrates a core DSA topic with simple examples, focusing on clarity and learning.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PW-5214/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-SY-AIDS.git
cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-SY-AIDS
```

### 2. Compile a File
Use any C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MinGW). Example with `g++`:
```bash
g++ DS1.cpp -o DS1
./DS1
```

### 3. Run Other Files
Just replace `DS1.cpp` with the program you want:
```bash
g++ DS5.cpp -o DS5
./DS5
```

## 🛠 Requirements
- C++17 or later  
- Any OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS)  
- A terminal or IDE (VS Code, CLion, Code::Blocks, etc.)  

---

## 📖 Topics Covered
- Arrays (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)
- Stack (Push, Pop, Peek)
- Queue (Linear / Circular)
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly)
- Trees (Binary Search Tree, Traversals)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS/DFS)
- Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Hashing (Chaining, Open Addressing)

---

## 📝 Example

**Stack Implementation (DS2.cpp)**  
```bash
g++ DS2.cpp -o DS2
./DS2
```

**Sample Output:**
```
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Display
Enter choice: 1
Enter element: 10
Element pushed!
```

## 📌 Notes
- Each file is **independent** – no linking between files.  
- Code is **commented** for better understanding.  
- Designed for **beginners** learning DSA step by step.
